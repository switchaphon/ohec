# Contributing

## Guidelines
:octocat: It is recommended to have an issue open for any work you take on and intend to submit as a pull request - it helps core members review your concept and direction early and is a good way to discuss what you're planning to do. If there is no issue tied to the Pull Request, please include a detailed description in the PR.

:100: We are aiming for 100% code coverage. Please keep this in mind when you're submitting new code.

:ok_hand: We use [PSR standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/) to keep our code sanitized and easy to follow.

## Environment requirements
`PHP >= 5.4` with `mbstring` extension
```bash
; php.ini
extension=php_mbstring.dll
```

## Development setup
1. Fork our repository
2. Clone your forked repository `git clone git@github.com:<your namespace>/bottomline.git`
2. Install development dependencies `make install-dev`
3. Run tests `make test`

## Development checklist
- Always add tests for the code that you write, including edge cases
- Place the new functions where they belong (collections, arrays, utilities, etc.)
- Add `README.md` doc entry for the functions
- Add function signatures to `__/load.php`
- Update the benchmark `bench.php`, this helps us to validate the performance of the library

## How to open a PR
- Create a branch in your forked repository and push your code into it
- Create a PR in [bottomline](https://github.com/maciejczyzewski/bottomline) that points to your forked branch
- Add description of the PR (issue links, etc.)

## Recommendation
- Squash commits into 1 commit before the PR is merged into master, this help reduces git tree and makes it easier to revert to a certain state. (can be multiple commits, but they have to be meaningful commits)
- Open PR title starting with one of the following words:
    + `Fix` - for a bug fix.
    + `New` - implemented a new feature.
    + `Update` - for a backwards-compatible enhancement.
    + `Breaking` - for a backwards-incompatible enhancement or feature.
    + `Docs` - changes to documentation only.
